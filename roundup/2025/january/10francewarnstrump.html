        <p class="lead">France has issued a strong response to comments by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump regarding Greenland, emphasizing the European Union's commitment to respecting sovereign borders and urging the United States to do the same. This follows Trump's remarks suggesting the possibility of acquiring the Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.</p>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-warning">France’s Position</h2>
            <p>French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot stated that the European Union would not tolerate any threats to its borders or sovereign territories. Speaking from Paris, Barrot said:</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>"The sovereignty of Greenland, as part of Denmark, must be respected. The European Union stands united in defending the inviolability of its borders."

                <footer class="blockquote-footer">Jean-Noël Barrot, French Foreign Minister</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The comments reflect growing concern among EU leaders about the potential implications of Trump's statements.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-warning">Greenland's Response</h2>
            <p>Greenland’s Prime Minister Múte Egede also rejected the idea of selling the island. In a New Year’s address, Egede emphasized Greenland’s aspirations for greater independence, while reaffirming the island’s current status as an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>"Greenland is not for sale. Our people’s right to self-determination is paramount, and we are focused on building a future based on independence and sustainability."
                </p>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-warning">Denmark's Concerns</h2>
            <p>Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen expressed disappointment over Trump’s remarks, calling them "counterproductive" to the strong alliance between Denmark and the United States. Frederiksen stressed the importance of cooperation among NATO allies and respect for each other's sovereignty.</p>
            <p>King Frederik of Denmark also weighed in, urging dialogue and mutual respect while reaffirming Denmark’s commitment to Greenland’s autonomy.</p>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-warning">Historical Context</h2>
            <p>Greenland, the world’s largest island, has been an autonomous territory of Denmark since 1979. Although the island receives significant subsidies from Denmark, it maintains control over its internal affairs. In recent years, Greenland has sought greater economic independence, fueled by its rich natural resources.</p>
            <p>The United States has long held strategic interest in Greenland due to its location in the Arctic. Trump’s comments echo historical attempts to acquire the island, including a U.S. proposal to purchase Greenland in 1946.</p>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-warning">International Reactions</h2>
            <p>Trump’s remarks have drawn mixed reactions internationally. While EU leaders have been critical, some analysts suggest that the statements reflect broader U.S. interest in Arctic geopolitics amid growing competition with Russia and China in the region.</p>
            <p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz described the comments as "baffling" and reiterated the EU’s commitment to upholding international law and territorial integrity.</p>
