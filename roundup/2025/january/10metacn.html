        <p class="lead">Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has announced a major policy change: the removal of independent fact-checkers from its platforms, replacing them with community-driven notes akin to those used by X (formerly Twitter).</p>

        <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.H6beqGxZkApQ8klSjBocAAHaEK?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" class="img-fluid mb-4" alt="Meta HQ">

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-warning">Why Meta Made the Change</h2>
            <p>According to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the decision stems from concerns that third-party fact-checkers were "too politically biased." Zuckerberg stated that this new policy would bring Meta closer to its "roots around free expression." The move also comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with US President-elect Donald Trump, who has been critical of the company's previous policies.</p>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-warning">Criticism and Reactions</h2>
            <p>The change has drawn sharp criticism from advocacy groups and experts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ava Lee</strong>, from Global Witness, described the move as "a blatant attempt to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration" and warned of its implications for hate speech and disinformation.</li>
                <li><strong>Chris Morris</strong>, CEO of the fact-checking organization Full Fact, called the change "a disappointing and backwards step."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, Trump praised Zuckerberg's decision, calling it a "long-overdue move toward fairness."</p>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-warning">How It Works</h2>
            <p>The new system, called "community notes," allows users to contribute context or clarifications to posts. This approach is modeled after X's system, which requires users with diverse viewpoints to agree on notes before they are published.</p>
            <p>Meta clarified that there would be no changes to how content related to self-harm, suicide, and eating disorders is handled.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-warning">Political Implications</h2>
            <p>The timing of the announcement has raised eyebrows. Meta's decision comes just weeks before Trump's inauguration, and the company has reportedly donated $1 million to the inauguration fund. Additionally, Joel Kaplan, a prominent Republican, has replaced Sir Nick Clegg as Meta’s global affairs chief.</p>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-warning">What’s Next?</h2>
            <p>Meta says the new policy will roll out "in the US first" with no immediate plans to extend it to the UK or EU, where stricter regulations on content moderation remain in place.</p>
            <p>The company acknowledges the risks involved, with Zuckerberg admitting that the new approach could lead to "catching less bad stuff" while reducing "accidental takedowns of harmless content."</p>
