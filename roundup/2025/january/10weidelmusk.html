        <p class="lead">Elon Musk's decision to host Alice Weidel, leader of Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, on his social media platform X has sparked controversy and raised questions about neutrality in political discourse ahead of Germany's general elections on February 23.</p>

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-warning">Event Details</h2>

            <p>German civil society group LobbyControl has raised concerns about potential bias, suggesting that Musk's involvement could be perceived as an indirect campaign contribution. Under Germany’s strict election laws, such actions are closely monitored.</p>
