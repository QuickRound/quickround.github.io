            <h2 class="text-warning mb-3">Historical Context</h2>
            <p>
                This could be the coldest January in the US since 2011, when average temperatures dropped to 30°F (-1°C),

            <h2 class="text-warning mb-3">The Polar Vortex Effect</h2>
            <p>
                The extreme weather is being caused by the polar vortex, 
                an area of cold air that usually circulates around the Arctic but has expanded over the US. 
                This has brought snow, ice, and sub-zero temperatures to regions unaccustomed to such conditions.
